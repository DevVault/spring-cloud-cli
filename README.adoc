Spring Boot CLI provides https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring
Boot] command line features for https://github.com/spring-cloud[Spring
Cloud]. You can write Groovy scripts to run Spring Cloud component
applications (e.g. `@EnableEurekaServer`). You can also easily do
things like encryption and decryption to support Spring Cloud Config
clients with secret configuration values. With the Launcher CLI you
can launch services like Eureka, Zipkin, Config Server
conveniently all at once from the command line (very useful at
development time).


== Installation

To install, make
sure you have
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot CLI]
(2.0.0 or better):

    $ spring version
    Spring CLI v2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT

E.g. for SDKMan users

```
$ sdk install springboot 2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
$ sdk use springboot 2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

and install the Spring Cloud plugin

```
$ mvn install
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:2.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
```

IMPORTANT: **Prerequisites:** to use the encryption and decryption features
you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (it's not there by default).
You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files"
from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files
in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).
